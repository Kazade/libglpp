# libglpp

This is a C++ implementation of libGL for the Dreamcast. There have already been at least
two other implementations of libGL written in C, but they have suffered from a number of problems, including:

 - Excessive memory usage
 - Inability to test on a x86 environment, which makes improvements difficult
 - Have been buggy or incomplete, or fail to follow the standard
